## Introduction

Hurricanes, one of nature's most powerful and destructive phenomena, have long captured the attention of scientists and the public alike due to their devastating impacts on coastal communities and ecosystems. This research project delves into the patterns of hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean, concentrating on factors such as wind patterns and proximity to landfall.

With climate change exacerbating hurricane impacts, including rising sea levels and warmer ocean temperatures, the necessity for enhanced prediction models is more urgent than ever. In comparison to existing literature, this study aims to address a gap by focusing on predicting the likelihood of landfall of tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean, crucial for effective risk preparation. While prior studies have explored various aspects of hurricane forecasting and intensification, this research takes a specific focus on using comparing Machine Learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of landfall. Therefore, this study aims to answer the following research question:

**RQ: How can the probability of landfall events be effectively modeled using logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest classifiers?**

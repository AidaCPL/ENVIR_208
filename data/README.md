# DATA: Dataset Description
The following page shows the overview of the dataset used for the research. Namely, it includes a description of the dataset and its source, a data dictionary, and the justification of why this dataset is useful to answer the research question. 

The dataset utilized in this study is the revised Atlantic hurricane database, known as HURDAT2, developed by Chris Landsea. HURDAT2 is compiled by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) through post-storm analyses of each tropical cyclone within its area of responsibility. Regular updates to the historical record are made to reflect changes introduced via the Best Track Change Committee, ensuring the database remains comprehensive and accurate (Landsea, 2022).

The decision to select HURDAT2 was motivated by its extensive coverage, and ongoing updates, providing a great source of historical hurricane data spanning from 1850 to the present day. This dataset includes various parameters such as date, time, latitude, longitude, maximum sustained wind, minimum pressure, and wind radii, enabling comprehensive analyses of hurricane characteristics and behaviors over time. The dataset encompasses tropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones occurring in the Atlantic basin, covering the North Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Sea (Etemad, 2019). Notably, this study excludes data prior to 1971, and 2004 in some cases, to avoid discontinuities related to changes in observation capabilities and technological advancements. 

The decision to focus on post-1971 data ensures the consistency and reliability of the dataset for the analysis of hurricane patterns and trends. Additionally, the format of HURDAT2 allows for detailed examination of various aspects of tropical cyclones, including genesis, intensity, track, and wind radii, facilitating comprehensive investigations into the dynamics of Atlantic hurricanes and their potential implications.

# CONCLUSION

In conclusion, the engineered features significantly enhance the performance of all three models, leading to higher accuracy and improved precision-recall metrics. The inclusion of features such as intensification rate and nearest landfall distance captures complex relationships and provides valuable insights into the underlying patterns in the data. These features not only contribute to better predictions but also help address the challenge of class imbalance by providing additional information about the minority class. Overall, the incorporation of engineered features demonstrates the importance of feature engineering in improving model performance and reliability in predictive modeling tasks.

Overall, based on the learning curves, the logistic regression model appears to be the best choice among the three models evaluated. Its ability to maintain high performance on both training and cross-validation sets with increasing dataset size suggests robustness, effective generalization, and superior predictive power.

One of the primary limitations of the study is the significant class imbalance in the dataset, with a disproportionate number of instances for the negative class compared to the positive class. This imbalance can bias the models towards predicting negative instances, affecting their ability to accurately generalize and predict positive instances. While the engineered features such as intensification rate and nearest landfall distance have shown promising results in improving model performance, there might be other relevant features not considered in this study. Exploring additional features could further enhance the models’ predictive capability and provide deeper insights into hurricane behavior. Thus, future research could explore the inclusion of additional features such as ocean temperature and geographic terrain characteristics to provide a more comprehensive understanding of hurricane dynamics and improve predictive accuracy. Finally, more domain knowledge on the formation of hurricanes and the multiple times hurricanes can lead to landfall. In other words, hurricanes don’t necessarily dissipate after hitting land for the first time, sometimes they make landfall several times before dissipating. 

In terms of the application, future study would benefit from considering regional variations in hurricane behavior and landfall patterns, such as differences between the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Sea, could lead to region-specific predictive models tailored to the unique characteristics of each region. Regional analysis could help improve the accuracy and applicability of predictive models for specific geographic areas.
